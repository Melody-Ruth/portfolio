##### Description
In this program the user uploads an image, selects the number of rows and columns, and then receives a randomly generated, solvable jigsaw puzzle based on their inputs. The user can click and drag to move the pieces, and preview the completed image if they get stuck.

##### File Structure
The code folder contains the html and javascript files needed to run the game, as well as outdated code.
The graphics folder contains all of the images needed for the game.
The Jigsaw Puzzle Maker page also relies on code from jqueryScripts.js, menu.js, main.css, menu.htm, and footer.htm. All are found in the top level of this repository.
