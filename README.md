##### File Structure
Each game has its own folder with graphics and code folders. The resources folder has p5, jquery, etc for any games that need them. The contactMe folder has the code and images needed for the "Contact Me" page. index.htm is the main page of the website. main.js has the javascript needed for interaction with the home page. menu.js has the javascript needed for the menu, and is used by all pages besides index.htm. Outdated files for the home page are in the old folder.
