Most images have two versions:
a low resolution to actually use in the game (for performance)
a full resolution version as a backup (in case increasing the resolution of the images is ever necessary)

Image descriptions:

cave_flood_thumbnail2.png - Thumbnail for the main page of the website
crystal.png - A single crystal. Low-res version is used for the crystals in the game


TODO: Add more descriptions
