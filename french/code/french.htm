&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an app I created to help myself practice conjugating french verbs.
The user can select which tenses they want to practice, and the app will generate a simple sentence combining a random pronoun, random verb, random language (French or English), and a random tense.
The user will then enter the translation of the sentence. The app keeps track of the number of correct and incorrect answers, as well as the number of skipped questions.
In addition, the user has the option to view a summary of the current verb, its translation, and its conjugation in case they get stuck.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was motivated to create this app because I found that studying the meaning of a verb, the family the verb is in, and the conjugation pattern for that family wasn't working well for me, since it was so different from how I actually used french verbs in my classes.
I wanted to practice by actually conjugating verbs, but the amount of flashcards needed to have one for every combination of verb, pronoun, and tense was ridiculous.
So, I decided to make a command line Java program for practicing french verbs. Midway through development, I switched to an Android app to make practicing more convenient.
I learned how to use Android Studio for this project, as well as continuing to hone my Java skills.
